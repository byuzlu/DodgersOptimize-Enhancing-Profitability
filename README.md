# DodgersOptimize
This project involves a comprehensive data analysis for the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team to maximize seat utility and overall profitability. By analyzing various factors, we provide insights to optimize business decisions related to promotions, services, and game-day operations. The primary objective is to enhance fan experience while increasing revenue from ticket sales and in-stadium purchases.

The analysis considers several unchangeable factors, including weather conditions such as temperature and precipitation, the opponent team's historical performance and popularity, the match date encompassing the day of the week, holidays and seasonality, and the game start time. By considering these variables, we can tailor our strategies to the unique circumstances of each game.

To achieve this, we employ advanced analytical tools and techniques. Regression models help identify and quantify the impact of various factors on attendance and revenue. Random forest methods are used for classification and prediction tasks, uncovering complex interactions between variables. Gradient boosting methods further enhance the accuracy of our predictions, providing robust insights for decision-making.

The data sources for this analysis include historical game attendance records, weather data from reliable meteorological sources, game schedules, opponent statistics, and promotional event data. This comprehensive dataset allows us to make informed and precise recommendations.

The analysis results guide strategic promotion changes by tailoring events to maximize attendance. Service offerings are enhanced based on predicted attendance and fan preferences, ensuring a better experience for attendees. Additionally, ticket prices are adjusted dynamically according to predicted demand, optimizing revenue.

Expected outcomes of this project include improved seat occupancy rates, higher revenue from ticket sales and in-stadium purchases, and an enhanced overall fan experience, leading to increased loyalty. These improvements are grounded in data-driven insights, allowing for more effective decision-making and business outcomes.

To implement this project, ensure all relevant data is collected and cleaned. Run the regression models, random forest, and gradient boosting methods using the provided scripts and interpret the results to make informed decisions on promotions, services, and pricing. Apply the recommended changes and monitor the impact on seat utility and profitability.

The requirements for this project include Python 3.10 and libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.
